## Backlog, Boards, Plans

- Backlogs display work items as a list and boards display them as cards
- You use your product backlog to quickly plan and prioritize your work
- You use your sprint backlogs and task boards when you work in Scrum
- You use your Kanban board to update work status and when you employ Kanban methods
- Each backlog is associated with a board, changes to priority order you make in one are reflected in its corresponding board
- Plans allow you to review the deliverables for several teams across sprints and a calendar schedule (Plans are in preview for Team Services. You access them by installing the Marketplace Plans extension.)
- Backlogs, boards, and plans are configurable for each team

### Backlogs

- portfolio backlogs
  - typically track high-level features, scenarios, or epics
  - help you organize your product backlog into a hierarchy of elements
  - provide product owners insight into the work performed by several agile feature teams
- product backlog
  - contains a prioritized list of user stories, deliverables, or work you plan to build or fix
  - corresponds to your project plan, the roadmap for what your team plans to deliver
  - is one of the main and mandatory artifacts in Agile
  - a set of requirements received from the business and formulated in the form of development activities
  - includes the following items: product features, different bugs, knowledge acquisition, technical work
    - are ordered depending on their business value
    - the higher the specific item is, the sooner developers will work on it
    - top-located items will be more detailed and clearer in comparison with the lower items
  - all of them should be clear and easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders
  - is built based on discussion rather than documentation
- sprint backlogs
  - contain just those items that each team is working on during a scheduled sprint or iteration period

---

## Sprints, Iterations

- iterative procedure for incrementally development
- steps by step improvements to develop products in pieces which are shipped at the end of each Sprint

---

## Scrum-Meetings

- all meetings must be finished in a well-defined time slot

- Backlog Refinement (fka Grooming, aka pre-planning)
  - is about maintaining and preparing the product backlog with its items and epics so that the team can use it as a basis for sprint planning
  - Product Backlog items are elaborated, evaluated and prioritized in such a way that the Development Team can compile its Sprint Backlog from them
  - a maintained product backlog should always contain at least as many prepared product backlog items in stock that can be used to plan a complete sprint
  - review of the prioritized backlog, discussion of requirements
  - ensure that duty (in form of backlog item) is ready to get implemented from team
  - is not for items selected for the current Sprint; it is for items for the future, most likely in the next one or two Sprints
  - is not one of the official Scrum events or occurrences such as Sprint and Daily Scrum
  - is a so-called activity that takes place as a meeting
  - should cover around 10% of the development teamâ€™s working time
  - product owner and team representatives arrange it in the mid-sprint time
  - Scrum is silent on how this work is done, but a frequently used technique is a focused workshop near the middle or end of the Sprint
- Sprint Planning
  - team picks backlog items for realization in next sprint --> "Sprint Backlog"
  - good fill level is challenge
- Daily Stand-up
  - very short (15 mins) daily meeting
  - team updates itself regarding progress, thematize issues which needs to be solved immediately after the meeting
  - The Daily Scrum is NOT a Status Meeting
- Sprint Review
  - at the end of the sprint the team demonstrates realized innovations to get immediate feedback from stakeholders
  - Stakeholder should get a workable version of the product
- Sprint-Retrospective
  - for continuous improvement of processes, collect improvement recommendations (to implement in upcoming sprints)
