- You use your Kanban board to update work status and when you employ Kanban methods
- Each backlog is associated with a board, changes to priority order you make in one are reflected in its corresponding board
- Plans allow you to review the deliverables for several teams across sprints and a calendar schedule (Plans are in preview for Team Services. You access them by installing the Marketplace Plans extension.)
- Backlogs, boards, and plans are configurable for each team
